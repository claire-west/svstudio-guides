<h4>Regarding Google Analytics</h4>
<p>Google Analytics is used to collect anonymous access data such as the number of visitiors and general regional distribution. No personal information is collected.</p>
<p>Basically it's just a way for me to tell if people are actually using this site of if I'm wasting my time.</p>
<p>You can opt out by installing the <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on</a>.</p>
