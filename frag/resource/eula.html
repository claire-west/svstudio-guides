        <div class="col">
            <p>Product licenses typically refer to a few core topics:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Ownership of the license</li>
                <li>Installation and use of the product activation code</li>
                <li>Use of the synthesized output</li>
                <li>Use of the associated branding, such as names, logos, and character designs</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The comparisons below will focus on areas in which the licenses differ. All licenses include some common restrictions, such as:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>You may not attribute the synthesized output to names that do not match the product name</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Attribution is not required</b>, but if you do choose to credit the vocals you must not attempt to mislead the audience into believing that the vocals were produced by the original voice provider of the product, a human singer, or different software</li>
                    <li>People who operate vocal synthesis software, edit the synthesized vocals, or perform other similar tasks are typically credited as "Vocal Editor", "Vocal Manipulator", "Vocal Engineer", "Synthesizer Programmer", or some similar role</li>
                </ul>
                <li>You may not attempt to reverse-engineer the product</li>
                <li>You may not resell the product or share it between multiple users</li>
                <li>You may not create sample packs using the synthesized output</li>

                <dd>Each product code allows for three activations, however the primary purpose of this is to account for accidental loss or hardware failure. Some products do not allow installation on multiple functional devices at the same time.</dd>
                <dd>This column indicates whether you are allowed to install and activate the product on multiple devices. Keep in mind that even when multiple devices are allowed, they must be used exclusively by the product owner, not shared between multiple people.</dd>

                <dd>Indicates whether you are allowed, not allowed, or required to state the use of the product along with any works created. For example, stating "original song ft. Solaria".</dd>

                <dt>Commercial Use (synthesized output)</dt>
                <dd>Whether you are allowed to generate revenue from the synthesized output of the product. Some companies may require that you give them notice before using a product for commercial use.</dd>

                <dt>Commercial Use (brand materials)</dt>
                <dd>Whether you are allowed to generate revenue from the logo, character mascot, or other aspects of the product aside from the synthesized output. Where this is not specified in the license, it is best to assume permission is required.</dd>

                <dt>Revenue Threshold</dt>
                <dd>When commercial use is allowed, some companies will require further negotiation of a contract and claim royalties on a work if it exceeds a certain amount in revenue.</dd>

            <p>On December 7, 2022 Eclipsed Sounds made a statement regarding the applicability of section 3.2.3 in the EULA to voice changers such as Vocaloid6 Vocalochanger and DIFF-SVC (<a href="https://twitter.com/eclipsedsounds/status/1600645437547073536?s=20&t=yk9kPABZqn2H2CrrS3qrUA">Twitter</a>).</p>
            <p>To summarize this policy, Eclipsed Sounds does not consider it a violation if a voice changer is used on the rendered output from their SVDs. This means you can use a Solaria render as input to Vocalochanger.</p>
            <p>It is still absolutely prohibited to use the rendered output from Eclipsed Sounds SVDs as the input to develop a new voice changer, secondary synthesizer, or create a vocal-only sample pack.</p>
            <p>It is important to note that this policy does not apply to any other SVD developer for SynthV Studio, and without clear guidance any use of rendered output from SynthV as input to a voice changer would violate the letter of the EULA.</p>
