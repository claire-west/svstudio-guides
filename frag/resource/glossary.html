                <dt>AI (voice database)</dt>
                <dd>Refers to voice databases created with the AI method, in which a machine learning algorithm analyzes vocal samples from a human voice provider. The AI engine uses this analysis to mimic the provider's voice and singing style in a way that matches the user's input in the application. Some features are exclusive to AI voice databases.</dd>

                <dt>Basic Edition</dt>
                <dd>The free version of Synthesizer V Studio. This version has <a href="https://store.dreamtonics.com/product/editor-svstudio-pro/">certain features</a> disabled. Synthesizer V Studio Basic is compatible with paid voice database products. Unlike a trial or demo, there is no time limited evaluation period and the software may be used for commercial purposes within the terms of the voice database(s) being used.</dd>

                <dt>Dictionary</dt>
                <dd>A list of word-to-phoneme mappings used to accomodate easier entry of lyrics and quickly adjust pronunciation of multiple notes at a time.</dd>

                <dt>Dreamtonics Co., Ltd.</dt>
                <dd>A small company based in Tokyo, Japan responsible for the development of Synthesizer V and Synthesizer V Studio.</dd>

                <dt>Engine</dt>

                <dt>Expression Group</dt>
                <dd>A distinct set of recorded samples of a specific pitch. Only applies to Standard voice databases. Selecting a non-default expression group gives the user control over which original sample is used during synthesis.</dd>
                <dd><i>Synonyms: pitch group</i></dd>

                <dt>Gender</dt>

                <dt>Group</dt>
                <dd>A set of notes that can be nested within one or multiple tracks. Multiple instances of the same group will remain linked, which allows identical sections of a song to be inserted and edited at multiple points in the arrangement without duplication of work.</dd>
                <dd><i>Synonyms: note group</i></dd>

                <dt>HDVM</dt>
                <dd>HDVM (High Dynamics Voice Models) is a feature that allows AI-driven changes to dynamics and timbre via the AI Retakes panel. Similar to auto-pitch tuning, HDVM attempts to create realistic improvisations to mimic a human vocalist.</dd>

                <dt>Instant Mode</dt>
                <dd>A setting toggled via the upper right corner of the piano roll. While instant mode is enabled, auto-pitch tuning will be run on every note as the user makes changes. These pitch deviations will not appear in the parameters panel until instant mode is toggled off.</dd>

                <dt>JUCE</dt>
                <dd>The GUI framework and rendering engine that provides the basis for the user-facing components of the SynthV Studio application.</dd>

                <dd>Free, <a href="https://resource.dreamtonics.com/download/">feature-limited</a> versions of voice databases. Lite voice databases are generally lower quality than their paid counterparts and cannot be used for commercial purposes. The use of a lite voice database must be disclosed when posting works that make use of them.</dd>
                <dd><i>Synonyms: lite voice, free voice</i></dd>

                <dt>Phoneme</dt>
                <dd>A symbol that represents a single sound SynthV Studio is capable of producing. A series of phonemes can compose a word or lyric, and all synthesized output is based on phonemes. Each supported language has a separate list of phonemes (English arpabet, Japanese romaji, and Chinese x-sampa). The phoneme sequence for a note is displayed above it.</dd>

                <dt>Pro Edition</dt>
                <dd>The paid version of Synthesizer V Studio. This version has access to all features and functions.</dd>

                <dd>Refers to voice databases created with the Standard concatenation method, in which a voice provider records an extensive set of discrete phonemes and phoneme transitions.

                <dt>SVP</dt>
                <dd>A project file for Synthesizer V Studio. Comparable to a VSQ or UST used by other vocal synthesis software, and some users may refer to it by those names. SVP files are saved in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON">JSON</a> format.</dd>

                <dt>Synthesizer V</dt>
                <dd>The legacy software released by Dreamtonics in August 2018. The legacy version has been retired in favor of Synthesizer V Studio, and all voice databases for it have been repackaged or otherwise recreated for the newer software product.</dd>

                <dt>Tuning</dt>
                <dd>A broad term relating to the manual adjustments performed in order to achieve a desired sound. Often involves adjustment of multiple parameters such as pitch deviation, loudness, and tension. Different producers often have different "tuning styles", similar to how vocalists have varying singing styles.</dd>

                <dt>Voice Database</dt>
                <dd>A virtual vocalist software product compatible with Synthesizer V Studio. Each voice database is created based on the voice of a human voice provider.</dd>
