    <p>Feature-limited Trial (FLT) voice databases are the same quality as their paid counterparts, however offer a reduced feature set and more restrictive terms of use. FLT versions are often made available to showcase new features added to Synthesizer V Studio, such as rap support.</p>
    <p>By using an FLT SVD you agree to the following terms, also found in the license.txt file in the SVD's installation directory:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>You may not use the FLT version for commercial purposes</li>
        <li>If you wish to publish a work created using the FLT version, you must clearly state the name of the voice database used and the fact that an FLT version is used</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Additionally, FLT voice databases have the following feature restrictions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>One track per project</li>
        <li>Limited cross-lingual capabilities</li>
        <li>45-second limit on output duration</li>
        <li>No Vocal Modes</li>
        <li>Pitch AI Retakes only (no timbre retakes)</li>
        <li>May only be used in the standalone version of the software (no plugin support)</li>
    </ul>
