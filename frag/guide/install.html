            <p><i><b>Synthesizer V Studio</b></i> is the editor, user interface, and vocal synthesis engine used to generate synthesized vocals. The Basic Edition is completely free for commercial and non-commercial use, but is limited to 3 tracks, 2 rendering CPU cores, and does not include all functions. The Pro edition can be purchased on its own or bundled with a paid voice, and includes additional auto-pitch tuning configuration options, user script functionality, cross-lingual synthesis for paid AI voices, alternate phonemes for non-AI voices, multicore rendering, and more.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>A <i><b>Voice Database</b></i>, sometimes referred to as a "voice library" or "voicebank", is the software component which the engine uses to recreate vocal samples. Each voice database is created based on the voice of a real human, usually either a voice actor/actress or a professional vocalist who is referred to as the "voice provider". For this reason, each voice database has a unique sound and may be suited to different styles of music. Voice databases are paid products, however some have a free "lite" version available.</p>

            <p>It is important to be aware of the licensing terms of a voice database you are using, which can be found in the installation folder as a "license.txt" file. At the time of writing all paid voices allow commercial usage of the rendered audio output, however this does not necessarily mean you can use other aspects of the product (such as the mascot character, if one exists) for commercial purposes without prior permission. When using a full (non-"lite") voice, you do not need to declare which voice was used, unless the license states otherwise.</p>
            <br/>
            <p><i><b>Lite versions</b></i> are available for free, and contain a lower-quality version of a voice database. These are intended for casual hobby usage, or as a trial/sample of the full product. In addition to having limited quality and functionality, it is important to note that lite voices cannot be used for commercial purposes. This means you cannot generate revenue from anything made with a lite voice. You also must declare up-front and clearly state that a lite version was used if you choose to share your creations (such as in the description or title of a YouTube video, ie. "Original Song ft. Eleanor Forte lite").</p>

        <div class="col">
            <p>There are two methods used to create voice databases for SynthV Studio. Voice databases are sometimes labelled as "Standard" or "AI" based on which method was used. More recently all voices that do not have both a Standard and AI version have been AI voices, though many have not been labelled as either which has caused some confusion. When in doubt, check the <a href="https://synthv.fandom.com/wiki/Status">SynthV Wiki</a>. Generally speaking, if it's not stated in the product name, voices made prior to 2021 are "Standard" and ones from 2021 onward are usually "AI".</p>
            <br/>
            <p><i><b>Standard voices</b></i> use a traditional concatenation synthesis method. The voice database is recorded by recording a large number of samples, which represent not only each phoneme supported by the language being recorded for, but also the combinations and transitions between each of those sounds, and this is all done at multiple pitches.</p>

            <p>Since Standard voice databases include all of these individual samples they usually come to around 300-500MB in size. Based on the user's input in the editor, the engine pitch-shifts and stitches together these samples (hence "concatenation") to create a cohesive sound. If you are familiar with Vocaloid or Utau, this is the method used by those engines as well. The Standard method excels at capturing the voice provider's vocal tone, but does not retain the provider's personal singing style.</p>
            <br/>
            <p><i><b>AI voices</b></i> use a relatively new method for vocal synthesis, introduced to SynthV Studio in December of 2020. Rather than the voice provider recording a large number of distinct phonemes and phoneme transitions, the database is created from complete songs. A machine learning algorithm analyzes the recordings (ie the "learning material") and, with some human supervision, builds a profile of the voice provider. Based on this profile the AI is able to generate completely new sounds inspired by the learning materials. Notably the original samples are not included in the voice database itself, causing AI voices to only be 10-25MB in size.</p>

            <p>SynthV Studio is capable of automatically introducing pitch deviations in an attempt to mimic the voice provider's personal singing style, and with a wealth of learning materials and machine learning analysis, it is even possible to have an AI voice sing in languages that the voice provider has never recorded. The AI method excels at capturing a voice provider's personal singing style, and allows for impressive features such as auto-pitch tuning and cross-lingual synthesis. It is important to note that while AI enables cross-lingual capabilities, AI voices still have a "native" language and it is normal for them to have an accent when utilizing cross-lingual synthesis.</p>

            <p>While we often refer to SynthV Studio as "the editor", it is important to note that there is a discontinued product from Dreamtonics known as "Synthesizer V" which is often confused with the current generation product. The original product is sometimes referred to as "R1" or "gen1" ("release 1" or "generation 1").</p>

            <p>Synthesizer V R1 is not compatible with any of the currently-available voices. Similarly you cannot use the SynthV Studio editor with any of the R1 voices. All R1 voices have been ported/re-released for SynthV Studio, so don't worry about missing out on the older options; you can safely download the current-generation product.</p>

            <p>If you are ever confused about which version is being discussed, you can easily tell based on the logo and the shade of green used.</p>

            <img src="/img/guide/r1-logo.png" alt="Synthesizer V R1 logo"/>
            <img src="/img/guide/svs-logo.png" alt="Synthesizer V Studio logo"/>

            <p>For the purposes of this guide, all mentions of "the editor" will specifically refer to the SynthV Studio user interface, not SynthV R1. All instructions below will be specific to SynthV Studio and may not apply to SynthV R1.</p>

                <p>When purchasing paid products, your activation code and download link will be emailed to you, or included in the box if a physical edition is purchased. Take care not to lose your activation code, do not delete your order confirmation email, and remember to back up your product codes in case you lose access to your email account (such as uploading an encrypted text file to Dropbox, or storing your codes in a password manager).</p>

                <p>SynthV products allow for three activations to account for unexpected hardware failure or other loss, but if you fail to properly deactivate and run out of activations you may be unable to activate the product on your new computer and there is no guarantee that customer support will be able to assist.</p>

                <p>Hardware upgrades, firmware updates, and changing to a new operating system can cause SynthV Studio to no longer recognize your computer as the same one it was activated on. <b>Always deactivate your products before starting one of those processes.</b></p>

                <p>To summarize:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>You can use your activation code three times (not simultaneously)</li>
                    <li>Deactivating the product "refunds" one activation, so you only lose an activation if you fail to deactivate (or are unable to)</li>
                    <li>There is no way to remotely deactivate the product, it must be done from the SynthV Studio UI (verification is done once when you enter the code; the software does not contact the server to check for revocation)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If you misplace your download link, you can get the latest installer by entering your activation code on the Dreamtonics website: <a href="https://auth.dreamtonics.com/store/download">https://auth.dreamtonics.com/store/download</a></p>

            <p>There may be times that you want to deactivate your products. SynthV products allow for three activations to account for unexpected hardware failure or other loss, but if you fail to properly deactivate and run out of activations you may be unable to activate the product on a new computer. Some users also choose to deactivate any products they are not actively using as a precaution against unexpected hardware failure.</p>

            <p>Hardware upgrades, firmware updates, and changing to a new operating system can cause SynthV Studio to no longer recognize your computer as the same one it was activated on. Always deactivate your products before starting one of those processes.</p>

            <p>After selecting an activated product, click the "Deactivate" button to deactivate it and reclaim one usage of your activation code. Deactivating SynthV Studio Pro will force the software to close, and upon restarting the program you will be prompted for your activation code. Deactivated voices will not produce audio output if assigned to a track and you will simply hear the default sine tone as if no voice was selected for the track.</p>
